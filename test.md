I am looking for work as a freelance bookkeeper. I like to use the word freelance as it best describes the relationship I have with my clients. No lock in contract, no minimum hours, I just do the work they request of me and charge only for the hours spent doing so. 
I can work onsite at your business and am also set-up at home as well. 
I work from my own laptop and have my own ancilliary.
By outsourcing your bookkeeping to me can free up your own time, have peace of mind that you are meeting all of your requirements, save of oncosts that permanent employees bring like computer ancilliary and super, and have no agreed minimum hours to pay me for.
Contact me today for a chat about how I can keep your books.
